library SoundUtils requires Stack, TimerUtils
//******************************************************************************
//* BY: Rising_Dusk
//* 
//* Sounds are a very picky datatype in WC3. They have many quirks that one must
//* account for in order to use them, and simply using the internal WE Sound
//* Editor isn't enough because the sounds it makes can't be played multiple
//* times at once. 3-D sounds are also very tricky because there are different
//* WC3 sound options that a user can have activated where certain sounds will
//* or will not work. This library attempts to streamline the handling of sounds
//* so that it is less likely to confuse you or cause problems.
//* 
//* The .mp3 format can be used for 3-D sounds, but there is one problem that
//* must be noted. If your computer supports the "Dolby Surround" sound option
//* in WC3 and you have it selected, then .mp3 files will work for 3-D sounds.
//* If you don't, however, they may not work depending on what you do have
//* selected and what is available for your computer. The .wav format works on
//* all possible settings, making them excellent for general use. This library
//* can interface with sounds of either type.
//* 
//* Known issues with sounds that this library resolves:
//*     - A given sound variable can only be played once at a time. In order to
//*       play a sound type multiple times at once, you need multiple variables.
//*     - A sound cannot be played at the same instant that it is created.
//* 
//* The DefineSound function defines a sound type based on some basic parameters
//* the user provides. DefineSoundEx is available if the user wants control over
//* all possible parameters, though they won't have an impact most of the time.
//* The duration parameter for DefineSound and DefineSoundEx is in milliseconds,
//* which is consistent with Blizzard's natives. To get the duration of a given
//* sound, open up the WE's Sound Editor, navigate to your sound, and select
//* "Add as Sound." In doing so, it will show its duration in seconds. Multiply
//* that number by 1000 and use it as the duration argument.
//* 
//* This library returns a sound variable with RunSound that you can change the
//* settings of using the standard JASS sound API. The library assigns default
//* values to the parameters for 2-D and 3-D sounds, that way they will run
//* without any further help.
//* 
//* The library automatically allocates, runs, and recycles a sound when you
//* call RunSound. This library will not automatically recycle looping sounds,
//* so you will need to call ReleaseSound on the looping sound when you want it
//* to end.
//* 
//******************************************************************************
//* 
//*    > function DefineSound takes string fileName, integer duration, ...
//*        boolean looping, boolean is3D returns integer
//* 
//* This function defines a sound type with a short list of parameters. The
//* returned integer serves as a SOUND_TYPE for running this type of sound at
//* any other point in a map.
//* 
//*    > function DefineSoundEx takes string fileName, integer duration, ...
//*        boolean looping, boolean is3D, boolean stopwhenoutofrange, ...
//*        integer fadeInRate, integer fadeOutRate, string eaxSetting ...
//*        returns integer
//* 
//* This function serves an identical purpose to DefineSound, but gives the user
//* full control over the entire list of parameters. Similar to DefineSound, the
//* returned integer serves as a SOUND_TYPE for running this type of sound.
//* 
//*    > function RunSound takes integer soundRef returns sound
//* 
//* This function runs a sound with the parameters held within the soundRef
//* integer argument. The soundRef argument is the returned value of DefineSound
//* or DefineSoundEx.
//* 
//*    > function RunSoundOnUnit takes integer soundRef, unit whichUnit returns sound
//* 
//* The same as RunSound, just this function runs a sound of a given type on a
//* specified unit.
//* 
//*    > function RunSoundAtPoint takes integer soundRef, real x, real y, real z returns sound
//* 
//* The same as RunSound, just this function runs a sound of a given type at a
//* specified point in 3D space.
//* 
//*    > function RunSoundForPlayer takes integer soundRef, player p returns sound
//* 
//* The same as RunSound, just this function runs a sound of a given type only
//* for the specified player.
//* 
//*    > function ReleaseSound takes sound s returns boolean
//* 
//* This function need only be called on looping sounds. If a sound is not
//* looping, it will be released and recycled on its own. This function should
//* be used on looping sounds when you want them to end.
//* 
//* Example usage:
//*     set SOUND_TYPE = DefineSound("Sound\\Path.wav", 300, false, true)
//*     call RunSound(SOUND_TYPE)
//*     call RunSoundOnUnit(SOUND_TYPE, SomeUnit)
//*     call RunSoundAtPoint(SOUND_TYPE, x, y, z)
//*     call RunSoundForPlayer(SOUND_TYPE, Player(5))
//*     call ReleaseSound(SomeLoopingSound)
//*
